CodeLab is a Visual Studio Code extension that transforms markdown files (`.mdcl`) into interactive command execution environments. Perfect for creating executable documentation, tutorials, training materials, technical runbooks, and interactive quizzes with live command execution capabilities.

## Works With

- Visual Studio Code 1.85.0 or higher
- [Cursor](https://cursor.so)
- [Windsurf](https://windsurf.dev)
- [Code Server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) - must enable `Insecure origins treated as secure` setting in browser for the address if you are using HTTPS

## Features

### Interactive Markdown Commands
CodeLab extends standard markdown with special command tags that become executable:

- **Execute in Terminal**: Run commands in VS Code's integrated terminal with visual feedback
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Click to copy code snippets directly to clipboard
- **Open Files**: Open files relative to the current document or workspace
- **Terminal Targeting**: Execute commands in specific named terminal instances
- **Block Execution**: Run multiple commands with a single button
- **Execution Tracking**: Visual indicators (green checkmark) for executed commands
- **Admonitions**: Styled callout boxes for notes, tips, warnings, and danger alerts
- **Interactive Quizzes**: Create multiple-choice quizzes with answer key validation

### Command Syntax

See the `command-examples.mdcl` file for a comprehensive demonstration of all features. Below are quick reference examples:

#### Individual Commands

Embed executable commands in markdown using backticks and action tags:

- Wrapping single commands:

```
`echo "Hello World"` {{ execute }}
```

- Executing a command in the main CodeLab terminal:
```
`npm install` {{ execute }}
```

- Executing in a named terminal (e.g., 't2' 't3', etc.):
```
`npm test` {{ execute 't2' }}
```

- Opening files in VSCode editor relative to the current file or workspace:
```
`./src/main.ts` {{ open }}
```

- Copying code snippets to clipboard:
```
`const data = []` {{ copy }}
```

- Interrupting current command before executing a new one:
```
`npm start` {{ execute interrupt }}  # Interrupt current process first
```


#### Multi-line Commands in Code Blocks

Create code blocks with multiple executable commands, each with its own button:

````markdown
```
`echo "First command"` {{ execute }}
`echo "Second command"` {{ execute }}
`echo "Third command"` {{ execute }}
```
````

#### Block Execution (Run All)

Execute multiple commands with a single "Run All" button:

```{{ execute }}
echo "Command 1"
echo "Command 2"
echo "Command 3"
```

#### Admonitions

Add styled callout boxes for different types of contextual information:

```
`General information` {{ note }}
`Technical details` {{ info }}
`Helpful tip` {{ tip }}
`Important caution` {{ warning }}
`Critical alert` {{ danger }}
```

Each admonition type has distinct colors, icons, and styling to draw attention appropriately.

#### Interactive Quizzes

Create multiple-choice quizzes with answer validation:

**Block format:**
````
```quiz id="unique-id"
Q: What is the question?
A) Option A
B) Option B
C) Option C
D) Option D
```
````

**Inline format:**
```
`What is your question?` {{ quiz id="unique-id" }}
```

**Answer Key Files:**

By default, CodeLab looks for answer key files matching your `.mdcl` filename:
- `filename.mdclanswer.yaml` (recommended)
- `filename.mdclanswer.yml`
- `filename.mdclanswer`

**Example:** For `tutorial.mdcl`, create `tutorial.mdclanswer.yaml`

The `.mdclanswer` naming convention:
- ✅ Is visible (not a hidden file)
- ✅ Works well with git
- ✅ Can be excluded via `.gitignore` to hide from students
- ✅ Clearly associated with the source `.mdcl` file

Example answer key structure:
```yaml
version: "1.0"

answers:
  unique-id:
    correct: "B"
    explanation: "Optional explanation text"
    alternatives: ["b", "option B"]  # Accept alternative answers
    caseSensitive: false  # Case-insensitive matching

settings:
  showExplanations: true
  allowRetry: true
```

**Hiding Answer Keys from Students:**

Add this to your `.gitignore` to exclude answer keys from version control:
```
# Exclude quiz answer keys
*.mdclanswer.yaml
*.mdclanswer.yml
*.mdclanswer
```

**Custom Answer Key Names:**

You can specify a custom answer key file for individual quizzes:

```quiz id="quiz1" answerKey="custom-answers"
Q: What is the question?
A) Option A
B) Option B
```

Or for inline quizzes:
```
`What is your question?` {{ quiz id="quiz2" answerKey="custom-answers" }}
```

When using custom answer keys, CodeLab will look for:
- `custom-answers.yaml`
- `custom-answers.yml`
- `custom-answers`

This is useful for sharing answer keys across multiple `.mdcl` files.


### Live Preview Panel
- Automatically opens when viewing `.mdcl` files
- Side-by-side view with the source markdown
- Interactive command buttons with hover effects
- Auto-refresh on document changes
- Maintains scroll position when switching tabs
- Visual execution tracking with green checkmarks
- Styled code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Hugo LoveIt theme-inspired admonition styling
- Real-time quiz validation and feedback

### CodeLens Integration
- Inline executable commands appear as CodeLens hints above the code
- Click to run, copy, or open files directly from the editor
- Support for terminal targeting and interrupt commands
- Toggle visibility via extension settings

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.85.0 or higher
- Node.js and npm (for development and building)

## Installation

### From VSIX Package
1. Download or build the `codelabv2-1.1.0.vsix` file
2. Install using one of these methods:
   - **Command line**: `code --install-extension codelabv2-1.1.0.vsix`
   - **VS Code GUI**:
     1. Open Extensions view (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
     2. Click `...` menu → `Install from VSIX...`
     3. Select the `codelabv2-1.1.0.vsix` file

### Building from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mjtechguy/codelabv2.git
cd codelabv2

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the extension (bundles all dependencies)
npm run package
npx @vscode/vsce package

# Install the generated VSIX
code --install-extension codelabv2-1.2.0.vsix
```

## Extension Settings

Configure CodeLab through VS Code settings:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `mdcl.enableCodeLens` | Enable/disable CodeLens for executable commands | `true` |
| `mdcl.autoOpenPreview` | Automatically open preview for `.mdcl` files | `true` |
| `mdcl.openRelative` | Basis for opening files using relative paths | `"File"` |
| | • `"File"`: Relative to the current markdown file | |
| | • `"Workspace"`: Relative to the workspace folder | |
| `mdcl.interruptDelay` | Delay (ms) between interrupt signal and new command | `200` |

## Architecture

CodeLab is built with:
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better IDE support
- **VS Code Extension API** for deep editor integration
- **Marked.js** for markdown parsing and rendering
- **WebView API** for the interactive preview panel
- **CodeLens Provider** for inline command execution
- **YAML** for quiz answer key parsing
- **esbuild** for bundling dependencies into a single output file

## File Format

CodeLab uses `.mdcl` files (Markdown CodeLab) which are standard markdown files with embedded executable commands. The extension automatically activates when opening `.mdcl` files.

## Terminal Management

- Commands execute in terminals named "CodeLab - main" by default
- Create named terminals with `{{ execute 'terminalName' }}`
- Terminals persist across command executions
- Use `{{ execute interrupt }}` to send Ctrl+C before executing

## Features in Detail

### Execution Tracking
- Buttons show a green border and checkmark when executed
- Each button tracks independently (even duplicate commands)
- State persists within the current session

### Scroll Position Persistence
- Preview maintains scroll position when switching tabs
- Automatically restores position when returning to preview

### Block Commands
- Wrap multiple commands in eval to reduce terminal echo
- Commands are joined with `&&` for sequential execution
- Single "Run All" button for entire block
